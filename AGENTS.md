# Coding Guidelines for surf-cloud

- Use Kotlin (with some Java) standard style: 4-space indentation, no trailing whitespace, end files with a newline.
- Keep commit messages short (50 characters or less) and in the imperative mood.
- After modifying any code, run `./gradlew build` in the repository root. The build must succeed before committing.
- Summarise changes in the PR body and mention build results.
