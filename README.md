## Cloud
- [ ] Fragw√ºrdiges timeout bei bootstrap auf client



# Setup

## First time:
1. start standalone and let the server generate the keys
2. start the client and let the client generate the folders (it will fail because the keys are not there)
3. Go back to the standalone and copy the `ca.pem`
4. Go back to the client and copy the `ca.pem` to the `certificates` folder
5. start the client again



## Generate certificates
````shell
wsl --install
````
````shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openssl
````
````shell
mkdir certificates
````

### Server Certificate
````shell
openssl genrsa -out certificates/server.key 2048
openssl req -new -x509 -key certificates/server.key -out certificates/server.crt -days 365 \
  -subj "/C=DE/ST=Berlin/L=Berlin/O=MyServer/OU=IT/CN=server.local"
````

### Client Certificate
Replace `{client-name}` with the name of the client

````shell
openssl genrsa -out certificates/{client-name}.key 2048
openssl req -new -key certificates/{client-name}.key -out certificates/{client-name}.csr \
  -subj "/C=DE/ST=Berlin/L=Berlin/O=MyClient/OU=IT/CN={client-name}.local"
openssl x509 -req -in certificates/{client-name}.csr -CA certificates/server.crt -CAkey certificates/server.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out certificates/{client-name}.crt -days 365
````
